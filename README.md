# Welcome to sample Project 2!

This project was created to demonstrate proficiency in Node.JS, React, MongoDB, and Heroku.

The site is a sample "portfolio" (obviously I didn't make cats or dogs) to demonstrate back-end proficiency, and is duly simple with regards to the front-end.

Live link on heroku is: https://doorfolio.herokuapp.com/portfolio 

Happy viewing!
